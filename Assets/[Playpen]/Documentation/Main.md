# Changes
- The project started from the "VR" template.
- `AutoHand` package was imported.
- `Polygon sci-fi city` package was imported.
- Created the `Playpen` scene as a copy of the `XRHands` from the AutoHand OpenXR package.
- The `Auto Hand Player Container/TrackerOffsets/Highlight Projection (R)/OuterMesh` uses the `Playpen\Assets\AutoHand\Examples\Materials\Highlight\Hands_transparent.mat` material, which uses the `Playpen\Assets\[Playpen]\Shaders\Hands_transparfent.shader` shader. This shader was not compiling, and has been replaced with the `Playpen\Assets\[Playpen]\Shaders\Hands_transparent.shader` shader.
